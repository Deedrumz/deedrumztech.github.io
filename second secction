                I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
                knowledge in software development. However, within a few
                weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and
                also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
                <br />
                push in my career as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
                <br />
                in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
                <br />
                different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
                <br />
                fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
                presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
                <br />
                <br />
                Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.

                I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio <br />
                Academy to my news feed. I read through their curriculum and <br />
                other details about the Bootcamp and I told myself this is the <br />
                opportunity I've been waiting for. <br />
                <br />
                I wasn't disappointed, the environment was well ventilated and <br />
                conducive, with competent instructors. Here I am today at OT&T <br />
